# -Python-Lab-Functions-

Create any 5 functions and write them. Give each function a suitable name, and demonstrate that they work by calling each of them with example inputs.

Some of these functions require the use of math functionality like the square root. If you choose to
implement these functions, consult Chapter 3.2 of the textbook for more information.

You may assume that anyone calling your functions will give reasonable arguments. You do not need to
check for bad inputs.

    1. Given a height and a base, compute and print the area of a triangle.
    2. Given a length, width, and height, compute and print the area of a cuboid.
    3. Given a string and a number, pad the string on the left with the given number of space characters and print the result. For example, given "Hello" and 3, the function will print the
string " Hello" (with 3 spaces before “Hello”). Use the string operators we discussed in
class.
    4. Given a year (an integer), month (an integer 1-12) and day (an integer 1-30), compute and print the approximate number of seconds that have passed between that day and the due date of the assignment (February 19, 2023). For simplicity, you may assume that the input date is in the past, and that all months have 30 days.
    5. Given two (x, y) coordinates, compute the Euclidean distance between them. The functionshould accept 4 parameters, or 2 for each point.
